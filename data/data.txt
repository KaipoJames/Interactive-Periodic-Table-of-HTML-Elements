Alternatively, you can nest the <input> directly inside the <label>, in which case the for and id attributes are not needed.

Content within each <a> should indicate the link's destination. If the href attribute is present, pressing the enter key while focused on the <a> element will activate it.
Lk <link> links The External Resource Link element (<link>) specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource.
