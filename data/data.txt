Rp <rp> formatting The Ruby Fallback Parenthesis (<rp>) element is used to provide fall-back parentheses for browsers that do not support display of ruby annotations using the <ruby> element. One <rp> element should enclose each of the opening and closing parentheses that wrap the <rt> element that contains the annotation's text.

S <s> formatting The <s> element renders text with a strikethrough, or a line through it. Use the <s> element to represent things that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate. However, <s> is not appropriate when indicating document edits; for that, use the <del> and <ins> elements, as appropriate.

Lbl <label> forms-and-input The <label> element represents a caption for an item in a user interface. To associate the <label> with an <input> element, you need to give the <input> an id attribute.

Alternatively, you can nest the <input> directly inside the <label>, in which case the for and id attributes are not needed.

Sc <source> audio-and-video The <source> element specifies multiple media resources for the <picture>, <audio> , or <video> element. This element has no content and does not have a closing tag.

A <a> links The <a> element (or anchor tag), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address. Content within each <a> should indicate the link's destination. If the href attribute is present, pressing the enter key while focused on the <a> element will activate it.
Lk <link> links The External Resource Link element (<link>) specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource.

Dt <dt> lists The <dt> element specifies a term in a description or definition list, and as such must be used inside a <dl> element. It is usually followed by a <dd> element; however, multiple <dt> elements in a row indicate several terms that are all defined by the immediate next <dd> element.
Dd <dd> lists The <dd> element provides the description, definition, or value for the preceding term (<dt>) in a description list (<dl>).
Mu <menu> lists The <menu> element represents a group of commands that a user can perform or activate. This includes both list menus, which might appear across the top of a screen, as well as context menus, such as those that might appear underneath a button after it has been clicked.
